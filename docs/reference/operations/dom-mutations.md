# DOM Mutations

## `append`

Inserts HTML into the DOM, inside the target element, after its last child.

```ruby
append(
  batch:          String,  # [null]   - add the operation to a named batch
  cancel:         Boolean, # [false]  - cancel the operation (for use on client)
  delay:          Integer, # [0]      - wait for n milliseconds before running
  focus_selector: String,  # [null]   - string containing a CSS selector
  html:           String,  # [null]   - the HTML to assign
  select_all:     Boolean, # [false]  - operate on list of elements returned from selector
  selector:       String,  # required - string containing a CSS selector or XPath expression
  xpath:          Boolean  # [false]  - process the selector as an XPath expression
)
```

## `graft`

Reparent the target element and its children to a new parent element in the DOM.

Grafted elements are moved, not recreated. This means that any Stimulus controllers attached to an element will `disconnect` and then immediately`connect` again, but **their internal state remains intact**.

```ruby
graft(  
  batch:          String,  # [null]   - add the operation to a named batch
  cancel:         Boolean, # [false]  - cancel the operation (for use on client)
  delay:          Integer, # [0]      - wait for n milliseconds before running
  focus_selector: String,  # [null]   - string containing a CSS selector
  parent:         String,  # [null]   - string containing a CSS selector
  select_all:     Boolean, # [false]  - operate on list of elements returned from selector
  selector:       String,  # required - string containing a CSS selector or XPath expression
  xpath:          Boolean  # [false]  - process the selector as an XPath expression
)
```

## `inner_html`

Sets the innerHTML of a DOM element.

```ruby
inner_html(  
  batch:          String,  # [null]   - add the operation to a named batch
  cancel:         Boolean, # [false]  - cancel the operation (for use on client)
  delay:          Integer, # [0]      - wait for n milliseconds before running
  focus_selector: String,  # [null]   - string containing a CSS selector
  html:           String,  # [null]   - the HTML to assign
  select_all:     Boolean, # [false]  - operate on list of elements returned from selector
  selector:       String,  # required - string containing a CSS selector or XPath expression

## [`insert_adjacent_html`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)

Inserts HTML into the DOM relative to an element. Positions are as follows, defaulting to `beforeend`:

* `beforebegin`: Before the target element itself
* `afterbegin`: Inside the target element, before its first child
* `beforeend`: Inside the target element, after its last child
* `afterend`: After the target element itself

```ruby
insert_adjacent_html(
  batch:          String,  # [null]      - add the operation to a named batch
  cancel:         Boolean, # [false]     - cancel the operation (for use on client)
  delay:          Integer, # [0]         - wait for n milliseconds before running
  focus_selector: String,  # [null]      - string containing a CSS selector
  html:           String,  # [null]      - the HTML to insert
  position:       String,  # [beforeend] - the relative position to the DOM element (beforebegin, afterbegin, beforeend, afterend)
  select_all:     Boolean, # [false]     - operate on list of elements returned from selector
  selector:       String,  # required    - string containing a CSS selector or XPath expression
  xpath:          Boolean  # [false]     - process the selector as an XPath expression

* `beforebegin`: Before the target element itself
* `afterbegin`: Inside the target element, before its first child
* `beforeend`: Inside the target element, after its last child

## `morph`

Fast lightweight DOM diffing/patching without a virtual DOM.

```ruby
morph(
  batch:                    String,  # [null]    - add the operation to a named batch
  cancel:                   Boolean, # [false]   - cancel the operation (for use on client)
  children_only:            Boolean, # [false]   - indicates if only child nodes should be morphed... skipping the parent element
  content:                  String,  # reference - the content that is going to be used to morph
  delay:                    Integer, # [0]       - wait for n milliseconds before running
  focus_selector:           String,  # [null]    - string containing a CSS selector
  html:                     String,  # [null]    - the HTML to assign  
  permanent_attribute_name: String,  # [null]    - an attribute name that prevents elements from being updated i.e. "data-permanent"
  select_all:               Boolean, # [false]   - operate on list of elements returned from selector
  selector:                 String,  # required  - string containing a CSS selector or XPath expression
  xpath:                    Boolean  # [false]   - process the selector as an XPath expression
)
```

When morphing an element with `children_only: true` you need to make sure that the content you're providing to the `html` value will result in a successful operation:

* it must have a **single** top-level container element with the same CSS selector as the target
* inside that container element is another [element node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType), **not a text node**

Consider the following example of `#foo`, a successful morphing candidate:

::: code-group
```html [show.html.erb]
<div>
  <%= render partial: "foo", locals: {message: "Am I the medium or the massage?"} %>
</div>
```

```html [_foo.html.erb]
<div id="foo">
  <span><%= message %></span>
</div>
```
:::

If the `<div id="foo">` was located in `show.html.erb` the morph would **not** succeed because the top-level container that you're replacing would not be present in the replacement HTML.

If you need to render a collection of partials, you'll have to wrap the render method in a container because you cannot have the top-level container in each partial:

::: code-group
```html [show.html.erb]
<div id="bar">
  <%= render collection: @bars %>
</div>
```

```html [_bar.html.erb]
<span><%= bar.message %></span>
```
:::

```ruby
morph(
  children_only: true,
  selector: "#bar",
  html: "<div id=\"bar\">" + render(Bar.all) + "</div>"
)
```

#### Life-cycle Callback Events

* `cable-ready:before-morph`
* `cable-ready:after-morph`

As with all operations, you can modify the items in the `event.detail` object inside of a `before-morph` to change the parameters of how the operation will be executed.

The `morph` operation's `event.detail` object has a special key called `content` which is a direct reference to the internal `template` element's `content` accessor holding the document fragment that will be morphed into your DOM.

This means that you can change the content which will soon be morphed into your page, but **you cannot assign the `content` to a new value**. Doing so would remove the reference!

Instead, use the DOM API and mutate children _inside_ of the content:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('cable-ready:before-morph', event => {
  event.detail.content.querySelector('#foo').setStyle('color', 'red')
})
```
